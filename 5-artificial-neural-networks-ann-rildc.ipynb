    "\n",
    "Predictions using ANN augmented with CTGAN produced results comparable to SMOTE augmentation. Intrestingly it had an MCC of 0 but a recall of 100% after generating 4 times the initial data. This shows the model augmented data was heavily imbalanced and predicted true for all cases hence the 100% recall. Accuracy and precision would still be high as there would be an overwhelming amount of True Positives and a few false positives but no  True and False Negatives . The MCC was a dead giveaway as the lack of true or false negatives would lead to a mcc of 0. \n",
    "A better picutre is seen with when using SMOTE, the model starts out unbalanced simlar to what is seen with GAN, so very high recall 99% and an MCC of virtuall zero (0.05). However when the data is balanced with smote the mcc rises to 0.4 and recall drops almost in half while mcc rises to 0.4 as Negative predictions and consequently more false negatives (and also false postitives). As the model is subsequently trained with more balanced data recall picks up without a corrsponding drop in mcc, pointing to a consistently balanced dataset. In the end, Accuracy, Recall, precision and f1  are 0.87, 0.83, 0.90 and O.86 while mcc  rose to 0.74 "
