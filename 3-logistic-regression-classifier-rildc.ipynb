    "### **Project Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an extension of Replication of Liver Disease Classification - KNN, where I replicated key parts of the paper - “Tabular Data Generation to Improve Classification of Liver Disease Diagnosis” by _Mohammad Alauthman et al._ - but used just KNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here I would be doing carrrying out the previous objectves while using Logistic Regression Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Replication Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Progressively apply and compare several supervised machine learning algorithms — KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and ANN — on the ILPD dataset.\n",
    "2.  Evaluate model performance before and after applying SMOTE to assess the impact of oversampling on classification quality.\n",
    "3.  Reproduce and analyze key evaluation metrics, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC, to verify or challenge the findings reported in the original study."

    "### SUMMARY:\n",
    "In summary, using a Decision Tree (DT) augmented with SMOTE consistently yielded high metrics (all above 91%, except MCC at 83%). However, these results still fell short of what was achieved with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), consistent with the reference paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, while CTGAN produced higher accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores, it still underperformed compared to SMOTE."
