    "### SUMMARY:\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried using the default parameters on the XGBoost model, and the results were quite good—matching those of SMOTE and even outperforming it in all metrics except precision and F1.\n",
    "Next, I’ll use a train–validation split before applying SMOTE only on the training data. After that, I’ll fine-tune the hyperparameters and then evaluate the model on the validation set."
