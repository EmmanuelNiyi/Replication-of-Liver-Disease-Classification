augmentation.\n","\n","SMOTE results:\n","\n","- Accuracy stays around 0.72–0.73 regardless of oversampling level.\n","\n","- Precision improves with balancing, but recall drops sharply (from ~0.93 to ~0.59).\n","\n","- MCC improves from 0.17 → ~0.48, showing better class balance handling even though overall predictive power doesn’t meaningfully rise.\n","\n","CTGAN results:\n","\n","- Accuracy climbs as high as 0.82, and recall becomes extremely high (~0.98), but\n","\n","- MCC collapses to nearly zero, meaning the classifier is essentially predicting one class most of the time.\n","\n","- Strong recall + very low MCC indicates severe class imbalance or mode collapse in the GAN-generated data.\n","\n","Overall:\n","\n","- SMOTE yields stable, balanced behavior for Logistic Regression, though only modest gains.\n","\n","- CTGAN boosts accuracy/recall artificially but produces unreliable, low-quality datasets for LR, making its outputs unusable."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":8732109,"sourceId":13724613,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":31192,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python
