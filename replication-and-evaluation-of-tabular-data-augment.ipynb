    "This notebook aims to replicate key parts of the paper: “Tabular Data Generation to Improve Classification of Liver Disease Diagnosis” by _Mohammad Alauthman et al._\n",
    "\n",
    "The original study evaluated the performance of several machine learning algorithms on the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) while examining the impact of two data augmentation strategies: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Their results indicate that K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) combined with SMOTE achieved the highest overall classification accuracy. More broadly, the study reported that SMOTE consistently outperformed GAN across all augmentation scenarios (NO-AUG, DD-AUG, and TD-AUG).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the authors also note that GAN-based augmentation provides greater model stability compared to SMOTE, even if its absolute accuracy is lower.\n",

    "### **Replication Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Progressively apply and compare several supervised machine learning algorithms — KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and ANN — on the ILPD dataset.\n",
    "2.  Evaluate model performance before and after applying SMOTE to assess the impact of oversampling on classification quality.\n",
    "3.  Reproduce and analyze key evaluation metrics, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC, to verify or challenge the findings reported in the original study."

    "I initially augmented the imbalanced dataset using SMOTE to equalize the number of samples for both outcomes — disease present and disease absent — bringing each class to 415 samples. This led to an increase of at least 5% in all evaluation metrics except recall, which dropped from 0.7 to 0.6. Conversely, the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) showed the greatest improvement, increasing from 0.1 to 0.5.\n",

    "After progressively increasing SMOTE oversampling up to 4×, performance improved substantially (accuracy 95%, MCC 0.90) with only a 4% train-validation MCC gap, suggesting limited overfitting; however, because SMOTE produces synthetic interpolated samples, I will validate performance on a completely external dataset to ensure true generalizability..\n",
