**Project Overview**\n\nThis notebook aims to replicate key parts of the paper: “Tabular Data Generation to Improve Classification of Liver Disease Diagnosis” by _Mohammad Alauthman et al._\n\nThe original study evaluated the performance of several machine learning algorithms on the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) while examining the impact of two data augmentation strategies: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE).\n\nTheir results indicate that K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) combined with SMOTE achieved the highest overall classification accuracy. More broadly, the study reported that SMOTE consistently outperformed GAN across all augmentation scenarios (NO-AUG, DD-AUG, and TD-AUG).\n\nHowever, the authors also note that GAN-based augmentation provides greater model stability compared to SMOTE, even if its absolute accuracy is lower.\n\n### **Replication Objective**\n\nIn this notebook, I will:\n\n1.  Progressively apply and compare several supervised machine learning algorithms — KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and ANN — on the ILPD dataset.\n2.  Evaluate model performance before and after applying SMOTE to assess the impact of oversampling on classification quality.\n3.  Reproduce and analyze key evaluation metrics, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC, to verify or challenge the findings reported in the original study.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"path = \"/kaggle/input/indian-liver-patient-ilp-dataset/Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD).csv\"\ndata=pd.read_csv(path)\n\ncols =

1. Dev Notes\n### 15-11-25, 3:00\nI have been able to apply KNN to the ILP dataset and with an accuracy of 0.67 and precision of 0.80, however this is without cross validation or data augmentation \n\nOther Metrics:\n- Accuracy: 0.667\n- Precision: 0.802\n- Recall: 0.739\n- F1-score: 0.769\n- Matthews Correlation Coefficient: 0.175\n- Confusion Matrix:\n     [[65 23]\n     [16 13]]\n\n### 15-11-25, 3:10\nI tried scaling with StandardScalar but it resulted in sliglty worse metrics so going I would not be proceeding with it going forward \nMetrics\n- Accuracy: 0.658\n- Precision: 0.816\n- Recall: 0.705\n- F1-score: 0.756\n- Matthews Correlation Coefficient: 0.201\n- Confusion Matrix:\n     [[62 26]\n     [14 15]]\n\n\n### 15-11-25. 17:30\nAdded 10 fold cross validation, there was a drop in precision but a rise in the MCC, change in other metrics were marginal at best \nMetrics\n- Average accuracy: 0.649\n- Average precision: 0.739\n- Average recall: 0.785\n- Average f1: 0.759\n- Average mcc: 0.103\n\nNext Id be Implementing SMOTE\n\n### 16-11-25. 11:14 \nI initially augmented the imbalanced dataset using SMOTE to equalize the number of samples for both outcomes — disease present and disease absent — bringing each class to 415 samples. This led to an increase of at least 5% in all evaluation metrics except recall, which dropped from 0.7 to 0.6. Conversely, the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) showed the greatest improvement, increasing from 0.1 to 0.5.\nAt this point, although accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score were above average, they were still lower than the results reported in the original paper.\n\nAfter progressively increasing SMOTE oversampling up to 4×, performance improved substantially (accuracy 95%, MCC 0.90) with only a 4% train-validation MCC gap, suggesting limited overfitting; however, because SMOTE produces synthetic interpolated samples, I will validate performance on a completely external dataset to ensure true generalizability..\n\nI also included MCC as one of the evaluation metrics — although it was mentioned in the paper, it was not originally used — because it incorporates all values of the confusion matrix (TP, FP, TN, FN) and provides a more reliable measure of performance on imbalanced datasets.\n\nNext: looking into augmentation with CTGAN\n\n### 16-11-25. 17:26\nImplemended CTGAN with variying results. Each time the model is fit to the data, it generates differnet data so, so reproducability is low. \n\n### 16-11-25. 18:46\n\n| Case    | Accuracy | Recall | Precision | F1 Score | MCC    |\n| ------- | -------- | ------ | --------- | -------- | ------ |\n| BAL-AUG | 0.7169   | 0.8661 | 0.7793    | 0.8192   | 0.1739 |\n| DD-AUG  | 0.7783   | 0.9203 | 0.8278    | 0.8696   | 0.0884 |\n| TD-AUG  | 0.8096   | 0.9417 | 0.8481    | 0.8912   | 0.1183 |\n| QD-AUG  | 0.8090   | 0.9465 | 0.8453    | 0.8916   | 0.0592 |\n\n\nI was able to specify the seeds,so the results are now more consistent. \nAugmenting the data with CTGAN showed promising results with accuracy, recall, precision, f1 and mcc at 0.8090, 0.9465,\t0.8453,\t0.8916, and\t0.0592 respectively and while good they still below the outcomes seen in SMOTE augmentation. \nA worrisome metric is mcc which is significatly low at 5% and especially when compared to the values of the other metrics indicating that there the datasets may be inbalanced. \n\n--------\nUpon inspection, the GAN-generated dataset was found to be highly imbalanced, with 2781 samples of class 1 and 539 of class 2.\n\n------\nI explored several approaches, such as oversampling the minority class and then augmenting with a GAN, or using a GAN followed by random undersampling of the majority class. Unfortunately, all of these strategies performed poorly.\n\nI also considered using SMOTE to balance the dataset before generating new data with a GAN. While SMOTE initially improved performance, the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) later dropped from 50% to 10%, and the other metrics remained low, as shown in the table below:\n\n| Case    | Accuracy | Recall | Precision | F1 Score | MCC    |\n| ------- | -------- | ------ | --------- | -------- | ------ |\n| BAL-AUG | 0.7506   | 0.6189 | 0.8472    | 0.7061   | 0.5250 |\n| DD-AUG  | 0.6590   | 0.7166 | 0.7396    | 0.7166   | 0.2892 |\n| TD-AUG  | 0.6426   | 0.7380 | 0.7159    | 0.7184   | 0.2319 |\n| QD-AUG  | 0.6307   | 0.7447 | 0.7034    | 0.7179   | 0.1865 |\n\n\nI realized that the issue stemmed from the GAN itself, which generates data randomly. As a result, some imbalance was inevitable. In the end, I reverted to the original approach, using only the GAN.\n","metadata":{}}]}
