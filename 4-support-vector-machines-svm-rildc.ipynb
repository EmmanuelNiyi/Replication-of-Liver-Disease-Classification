performance, while CTGAN inflates recall but destroys class balance.\n","\n","SMOTE results:\n","- Accuracy gradually improves from 0.71 → 0.76 as oversampling increases.\n","- Recall drops from an overfitted 0.99 (unbalanced) to a more realistic ~0.59 once classes are balanced.\n","- Precision becomes very high (0.90+) with heavier SMOTE.\n","- MCC rises from negative (bad) to solid values around 0.56, indicating genuinely better-balanced decision boundaries.\n","\n","CTGAN results:\n","- Accuracy increases to ~0.81, and recall remains extremely high (0.95–1.00).\n","- However, MCC is essentially 0, even dipping slightly negative at times — meaning the classifier isn’t learning a real boundary and is dominated by GAN-induced imbalance.\n","- High recall + near-zero MCC again confirms GAN-generated data is distorted/unbalanced for SVM.\n","\n","Overall:\n","- SMOTE produces meaningful, stable improvements for SVM, with MCC showing strong gains.\n","- CTGAN results are misleadingly good on surface metrics but fundamentally unreliable due to class imbalance and poor separability in generated data."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":8732109,"sourceId":13724613,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":31192,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python
